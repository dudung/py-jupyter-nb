Simulation and Modelling of Physical Systems [`Ã—`](https://akademik.itb.ac.id/app/dosen:197312011999031002/kurikulum/silabus/40272/view)

+ This course is designed to provide a background in numerical methods and in computer simulation methods for undergraduate physics students.
+ It includes numerical differentiation and integration, systems of linear equations, root-finding methods, data analysis using graphical techniques and Fourier analysis, grid-based and particle-based simulation techniques, the use of random numbers in simulation, and data classification with artificial neural networks and support vector machines.
+ Python will be used in this course, along with a few modules and packages, as the programming language.
