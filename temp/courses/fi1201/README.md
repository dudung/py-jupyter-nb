Elementary Physics IIA [`Ã—`](https://akademik.itb.ac.id/app/dosen:197312011999031002/kurikulum/silabus/40547/view)

+ This course is designed to give the common basic concepts of elementary physics for undergraduate students.
+ It covers electrostatics, Gauss law, electric potential and energy, capacitor, magnetostatics, electromotive force and magnetic induction, alternating current, electromagnetic wave, modern physics, and atomic physics.
+ Python in Jupyter notebook use in this course is optional but encouraged since it can support mathematical equations and display numerical examples interactively at the same time.
