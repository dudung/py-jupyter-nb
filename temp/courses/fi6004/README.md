Physical Data Processing [`Ã—`](https://akademik.itb.ac.id/app/dosen:197312011999031002/kurikulum/silabus/43107/view)

+ This course is designed to give undergraduate students the concepts of digital processing for data from physical systems.
+ It covers Fourier transforms, convolution and deconvolution, digital filtering, signal analysis using auto- and cross-correlations, power spectrum, and transfer function estimation with linear and non-linear regression, and robust estimation.
+ Python in Jupyter Notebook, and also available modules and packages, will be used in this course.


## topics
+ Fourier transforms: Continuous Fourier transform (CFT), discrete Fourier transform (DFT), fast Fourier transform (FFT), cascade decimation, Z-transform, Hilbert transform.
+ Convolution and deconvolution.
+ Digital filtering: Filter coefficients, low-pass filter, high-pass filter, band-pass filter, moving average, median, robust filters.
+ Signal analysis: auto-correlation and cross-correlation, power spectrum.
+ Transfer function estimation: linear regression, non-linear regressions, robuts estimation.
